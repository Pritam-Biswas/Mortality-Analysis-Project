## MORTALITY ANALYSIS 
#### EDAV Final Project

The project aims at answering three most intersting questions related to mortality statistics that we could think of. We explored the statistics starting from child mortality, to the causes of death. We also included several visualizations that compare the mortality statistic across the countries, economy, income groups, age groups, sex, and by the cause. 
Our journey through the project was interesting as we observed a few results that were pretty surprising, although there were a couple of results that were as expected. We hope you find the work and results to be interesting too.
