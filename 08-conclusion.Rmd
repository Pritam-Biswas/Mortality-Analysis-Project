# Conclusion

<p>
The graphs and information helped us answer the questions we were most curious about. The previous sections in the bookdown mentions a detailed summary of each of the graphs included. \
We could understand the variation in child mortality, number of deaths across the world, various causes of death, number of deaths in different age and sex groups.

<h3>Future Work</h3>
